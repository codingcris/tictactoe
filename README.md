Made this web app as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a great exercise in code modularity, module communications, and dom manipulation as well as event handling. Currently the code is structured using IFFE modules. Future versions will use ES6 classes and modules. Game features include Plaver VS Player game mode as well as Player VS AI game mode. My AI players include an easy, medium, and hard bot. Notably, the hard bot implements the minimax algorithm for optimal gameplay making it impossible to beat.
